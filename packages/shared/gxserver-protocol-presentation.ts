  never negative, and the sidebar hides the pair entirely at 0/0.
- The `pr*` fields are present only when `gh` is installed AND authenticated

CDXC:Spaces 2026-08-27:
A Space is a server-owned saved sidebar filter: a name, an icon id, a color, a
manual position, and the sidebar members it shows. Members are sidebar project
collections ("groups") and ungrouped projects, and a member belongs to at most
one Space. gxserver owns the document so every client on that daemon
shares one Space set, and a remote daemon's Spaces stay that daemon's own.

The wire state is fully normalized by gxserver:
  - `order` is the authoritative Space ordering; `spaces` is keyed by spaceId.
  - A project held by a collection can never carry direct membership, so
    gxserver strips grouped project ids from `memberProjectIds`.
  - Member collection ids that no longer exist are dropped; a collection
    disappears from the collections document as soon as it empties.
  - Member ids are unique across Spaces; the first Space in sidebar order wins.
  - Member ids are deduped, and ids/names/icon ids are bounded (256 chars,
    512 ids per list, 256 Spaces).
  - `color` is normalized to lowercase `#rrggbb`, falling back to the shared
    sidebar palette.
  - An EMPTY Space is valid and kept, unlike an empty project collection.
Member project ids for a deleted project may linger as soft references, so
clients must tolerate member ids they cannot resolve. Worktree inheritance and
the built-in "Other" view (packages/shared/sidebar-spaces-other.ts, deleted 2026-10-01) are pure
client concerns and never stored.
Clients write-through-sync the whole state via /api/updateSidebarSpaces and read

CDXC:Sessions 2026-09-11 WHY:
User-defined session tags are a gxserver-owned catalog, per daemon, exactly like
Spaces: `order` is authoritative, `tags` is keyed by tag id, and clients
write-through-sync the whole document via /api/updateCustomSessionTags. A tag
removed from the document is cleared from every session that carried it in the
same write, so a session can never point at a tag the daemon no longer knows.
The catalog rides the presentation snapshot and the mobile summary so every

  The inactivity window THIS daemon actually applies in its auto-settle sweep,

  its OWN `sidebarAutoSettleAfterDays`, so a client that applied the local
  window to every machine would park remote sessions the remote daemon still
  considers active (the recorded P2 minor).

  - ABSENT: this daemon predates the field. The client then keeps the P2
    behavior for LOCAL rows (the local settings value, which is the same file
    the local daemon reads) and applies NO client-side inactivity settle to
    remote rows — the remote server's own `settledOverride` is the only truth
    for a machine that cannot state its window.
  - `null`: this daemon has inactivity auto-settle disabled.
  - a number: that daemon's window in days.
