The message is undelivered — the deadline passed with nothing in the transcript,
the transcript recorded a different prompt in its place, or the send itself
failed (see `UndeliveredSendReason`). Exactly one
terminal capture happens here — never in the poll loop — and the verdict is
decided in suppression-first order, because a false "your message was lost" is
worse than a missed one:
  1. Codex queued the input client-side (nothing is written until the running
     turn ends) — say so, at severity info. (Silence only.)
  2. The screen explains itself (login expired, trust dialog, ...) — publish THAT
     notice so the client renders the specific card, re-sourced to the watchdog.
     Skipped for input the CLI intercepted: the screen then belongs to the
     command that just ran (`/model`'s picker, `/usage`'s quota view), and
     narrating it as "what the terminal is showing INSTEAD of your message" is
     wrong twice over. A genuinely blocking screen is still published by the
     screen detector on the next read, which does not need the watchdog.
  3. Clean screen: consult Claude's own session registry before blaming the
     process.
  4. The agent is working at the deadline — normal, stay silent: either the
     turn that was already running is holding the input queued, or the send
     itself started the turn. (Silence only, and NOT for `MismatchedInput`:
     there the running turn is the one the mismatched input started, so reading
     it as an innocent explanation is exactly what swallowed this alarm before.)
  5. Otherwise the honest verdict — after one last-chance scan of freshly
     re-resolved transcript candidates, which clears a send whose watched file
     rotated out from under the watchdog: nothing proves the message arrived
     (a WARNING suggestion, not an error) — or, for `MismatchedInput`, positive
     proof that something else was submitted.

/*
CDXC:AgentScreenDetection 2026-08-28:
Deadline-time delivery proof that does not trust the send-time path. Resolution
runs twice — once as the send did (recorded path first) and once by session id
alone — so a stale recorded path cannot mask the live file the id sweep finds.
Every candidate written since the send gets its tail scanned for the message,
both as raw JSON-escaped bytes and as decoded composer submissions (which is
what covers a send too short for the raw scan). A hit means the message IS in
a transcript the agent is writing, so the alarm would be a lie; the residual
risk — an identical earlier message in the same tail masking a real loss — is
the cheap side of "a false 'your message was lost' is worse than a missed one".
