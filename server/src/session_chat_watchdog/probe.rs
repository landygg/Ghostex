        message history file) and every rollout on this machine.

CDXC:AgentScreenDetection 2026-08-19:
The flagship case never reaches the watchdog above: when the agent CLI is dead
or was never in the pane, the send fails INSIDE the Ctrl+G preservation
handshake (or on the zmx write), so the handler returns an error before any
delivery verification exists and the user gets a generic toast with no
explanation of what the terminal is showing.

This is that missing escalation: the same one-capture verdict the watchdog takes
at its deadline, taken once, immediately, for a send the terminal refused. It
does not retry the send, does not touch the terminal, and takes exactly one
capture. It registers as this session's watchdog so a later send supersedes it
the same way it supersedes a real one.
