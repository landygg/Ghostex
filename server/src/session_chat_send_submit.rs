/// CDXC:SessionChat 2026-09-26 DECISION:
/// User: a Codex message must never again show as sent in the chat while it sits unsent in the CLI's input box ("my message was in the input box of the cli just needed to hit enter"). After the Return, the send reads Codex's input box; if the message is still there, it presses Return once more, as the user had to, logs the screen so the cause can be fixed at its source, and reports a failure if Codex still keeps it.
/// WHY: the input box is read from its own region (Codex's styled cells, Claude Code's rule-bounded box), so a history row that repeats the message is never mistaken for it. A screen that cannot be read, or an input box that is gone (a working Codex, a dialog), counts as taken, so this never blocks a message it cannot see.
/// CDXC:SessionChat 2026-10-07 WHY: Empryo takes the same check, and the second press repeats the key the send used. A slash command goes with Enter, which only arms while Empryo 3.9.1-beta's repo map is still building ("Enter again sends before the map is ready"), so a second Enter is Empryo's own way to run it; a message goes with Alt+Q, which skips that gate, and its second press stays Alt+Q because Enter would steer a running turn instead of queueing the message.
/// CDXC:SessionChat 2026-10-04 WHY: Claude Code takes the same check. A `ghostex agents send` whose paste Claude would not submit (a form feed in it; see `picture_terminal_control_characters`) answered "accepted" while the message sat in Claude's input box, until the delivery watchdog handed it back to the chat composer as a draft. Claude's input box is cleared when it still holds the message after the second Return, because pressing Enter there would not send it either and the failure already says nothing was sent.
