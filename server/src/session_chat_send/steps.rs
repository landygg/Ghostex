CDXC:SessionChat 2026-08-22:
Answering an on-screen picker (Claude Code's resume-usage chooser today): type
the chosen row's NUMBER, and nothing else.

This used to walk the highlight with arrow keys and confirm with Enter, which
always answered row 1. Measured on a zmx pty: `ESC [ B` written into that picker
does not move the highlight at all, so every walk was a no-op and the trailing
Enter committed whatever was already highlighted. The digit both selects and
commits — no Enter, no settle, nothing to pace. Same behaviour, same fix, and
same reason as Claude's AskUserQuestion selector above.

One verbatim write: no clear burst and no bracketed paste, because this is a
keystroke for a dialog that owns the input line, not text for a composer.

CDXC:AgentScreenDetection 2026-09-04 DECISION:
The permission prompt is the one picker whose keys are an arrow walk plus
Enter instead of a digit (user: "Enter for Yes and down arrow then Enter for
No"); `SessionChatTerminalPicker::answer_key` derives the walk from the
highlight in the answer-time capture, and this still writes it verbatim.
