//! Session Chat prompt-queue runtime, split by concern. Every submodule is glob re-exported

CDXC:SessionChat 2026-08-21:
The scheduler half of the Ghostex chat prompt queue. `session_chat_queue.rs`
owns storage, the endpoints and the frame carriage; this module owns the clock
that decides WHEN a queued row is allowed to reach the agent.

The daemon owns this decision rather than any client, so a queue drains with
every client closed, the phone locked, or the desktop app quit.

Shape is deliberately `delayed_sends.rs`'s: a 1s tick, a non-working stability
window tracked per session, a guarded claim so two ticks cannot double-fire, and
restart recovery that never silently re-sends. The differences are the readiness
rule and the drain rate:

  - Ready = the session is idle, or sits in the attention a hook's Stop
    entered (`attentionSource: turnComplete`) with no question/approval card
    pending, AND the chat transcript lifecycle is not `Working`, held for
    SESSION_CHAT_QUEUE_STABILITY_MS.
  - Every other `attention` NEVER releases the queue. A prompt fired while the
    agent sits on a permission/approval prompt would be swallowed as the ANSWER
    to that prompt. Late delivery is harmless; early delivery corrupts a turn.
  - ONE prompt per idle window. Delivering the head makes the agent work again,
    so the clock restarts from zero after every attempt and row #2 waits for the
    next stop. This is never a "drain the whole queue" loop.
  - An input-blocking notice or unresolved quota, authentication, or agent error is not a delivery opportunity: the head
    row is marked `failed` with the notice title and the drain stops until the
    user retries or deletes it. The text is never lost. Queue eligibility uses
    `session_chat_notice/rules.rs`'s own predicate, NOT `severity == error`: a trust
    dialog or a first-run setup screen is only catalogued `Warning`/`Info` and
    would still eat a prompt as the ANSWER to itself.

Cost discipline: only sessions that actually hold a pending row are considered,
so a daemon with no queues anywhere does one indexed SQLite query per second and
nothing else. Transcripts are never walked for a session with an empty queue.
