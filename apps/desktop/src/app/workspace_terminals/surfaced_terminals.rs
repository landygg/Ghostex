        surfaced when it was published: after a session closed while the app

        promoted tab is absent from the stale set, so the pane the user is
        looking at stayed empty until clicked. Prepare those exact active

        A restored workspace keeps the sessions its panes surfaced at quit, but their daemon providers may have gone to sleep (auto-sleep, or the machine rebooted) while the app was closed, and attach alone cannot show a session with no zmx provider. So the first visit to each restored project wakes its panes' surfaced-but-sleeping sessions once; later sleeps are user decisions, so the project key is consumed on that pass and never re-armed.
        Only a return to the project does this. It runs on the first focus snapshot that describes this project, and when that snapshot heads for a session no pane surfaces (a new agent, or a background row) it wakes nothing: the requested session owns the visit and the covered sessions stay asleep until clicked. Waking them anyway respawned sessions the user had not asked for, and before R7 the wake's result also took focus from the new agent.
        Supersedes the 2026-08-07 note, which woke on the first authoritative pass whatever it was for.
        With Click to Wake Sleeping Panes on, the pass wakes nothing at all and those panes show their wake placeholder; see the SessionSleep decision on `select_sleeping_local_workspace_tab`.

        The remote counterpart of `attach_surfaced_local_workspace_terminals`.
        Parking a workspace always kills its SSH clients, so every restored
        remote tab is dead by definition and used to need a tab-strip or
        sidebar click to come back. Re-arm each surfaced remote tab of the live
        remote workspace as soon as its machine reports connected — the same
        "prepare a plan, insert the payload into that exact mount slot" shape
        the local path uses. This deliberately does not select tabs, move pane
        focus, change the titlebar mode, or publish presentation focus: the
        restored layout already says what is surfaced, and a split's other
        panes must re-arm without fighting each other for focus.
        Parked projects reuse shell ids, so both plan lookup and completion must
        resolve the complete remote key in the currently active project.
